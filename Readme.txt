This compartmental model of a hippocampal granule cell has spinous synapses
placed on the second-order dendrites.  Changes in shape and connectivity of
the spines usually does not effect the synaptic response of the cell unless
active conductances are incorporated into the spine membrane (e.g. voltage-dependent
Ca2+ channels).  With active conductances, spines can generate spike-like events.
We showed that changes like fusion and branching, or in fact any increase in the 
equivalent spine neck resistance, could trigger a dramatic increase in the spine's
influence on the dendritic shaft potential.
 

After auto-launching the model, run the parameter set desired from the control
box.
